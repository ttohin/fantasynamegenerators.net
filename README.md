## Scientific creature name generator
This name generator will give you random scientific names for animals and creatures.
The names are based on the real scientific names we use today, but part of the names in this generator have been randomized to create new words and names.

The first 5 names in this generator combine 2 real words used for animals, and thus creates a new type of creature. It's similar to mixing up animal names or characteristics, like 'Spotted Elephant' or 'Dragon Seal', but with scientific names instead.
The last 5 names are randomized. I took partial names and combined those to form new, but fake scientific names. Some parts you might recogniz,e and those will generally fit whichever animal it original belonged to, but most can be used for nearly every creature.
